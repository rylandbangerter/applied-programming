## Overview

**Project Title**: MBGPT

**Project Description**: An AI that can predict statistics of baseball players in upcoming games.

**Project Goals**: To determine results of future baseball statistics accurately through an easy-to-use predictive AI.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Install python on computer.
2. Install the xgboost, pandas, and scikit-learn python libraries.
3. Run one of our working models such as ```gettingStartedXgboost.py``` or ```shoheiPredictions.py```.
4. You can go to our [website](https://rylandbangerter.github.io/applied-programming/mbgpt/index.html) to what it looks like.
5. You can also go to [machine Learning](https://rylandbangerter.github.io/applied-programming/index.html) to see the results.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Run one of the ```.py``` files provided.
2. See results (currently is not very customizable).

## Development Environment
